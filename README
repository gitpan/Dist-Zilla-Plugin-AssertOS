NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::AssertOS - Require that our distribution is running
    on a particular OS

VERSION
    version 0.06

SYNOPSIS
      # In dist.ini - It is important that AssertOS follows MakeMaker or
      # ModuleBuild

      [MakeMaker]

      [AssertOS]
      os = Linux
      os = FreeBSD
      os = cygwin

    The resultant distribution will die at "Makefile.PL" unless the platform
    the code is running on is Linux, FreeBSD or Cygwin.

DESCRIPTION
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::AssertOS is a Dist::Zilla plugin that integrates
    Devel::AssertOS so that CPAN authors may easily stipulate which
    particular OS environments their distributions may be built and
    installed on.

    The author specifies which OS or OS families are supported. The
    necessary Devel::AssertOS files are copied to the "inc/" directory and
    "Makefile.PL" or "Build.PL" is mungled to include the necessary
    incantation.

    On the module user side, the bundled "inc/" Devel::AssertOS determines
    whether the current environment is supported or not and will die
    accordingly.

    As this plugin mungles the "Makefile.PL"/"Build.PL" it is imperative
    that it is specified in "dist.ini" AFTER "[MakeMaker]" or
    "[ModuleBuild]".

    This plugin also automagically adds the "no_index" metadata so that
    "inc/" is excluded from PAUSE indexing. If you use
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaNoIndex, there may be conflicts.

  ATTRIBUTES
    "os"
        Specify as many times as wanted the OS that you wish your
        distribution to work with. See Devel::AssertOS and Devel::CheckOS
        for what may be given.

    "bundle"
        If set to c<0> Devel::AssertOS will not be bundled in the
        distribution. It will instead be added to "configure_requires" in
        the "META" files so CPAN clients can install it before running
        "Makefile.PL". The default is 1, so Devel::AssertOS is bundled in
        "inc".

  METHODS
    These are required by the roles that this plugin uses.

    "mvp_multivalue_args"
    "gather_files"
        Required by Dist::Zilla::Role::FileGatherer.

    "setup_installer"
        Required by Dist::Zilla::Role::InstallTool.

    "metadata"
        Required by Dist::Zilla::Role::MetaProvider.

KUDOS
    Based on use-devel-assertos by David Cantrell

    Build.PL support contributed by Yanick Champoux

    Thanks to Ricardo Signes, not only for Dist::Zilla, but for explaining
    Dist::Zilla::Role::InstallTool's place in the build process. This made
    this plugin possible.
